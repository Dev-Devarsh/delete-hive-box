# hive_test

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In this code i have expalined how to delete a hive box which contanies previous hive schema and if you want to add more information to that schema or delete some fields from that schema then you have to delete that box first

OR 

You can change all the hive Box name to prevent types cast error for previous hive schema and new hive schema
